# MessageTool
Package contains some tooling for client/server communication and will have a test script with it. 
The tool will include 1 server that listens for connections and 1 or 2 clients that connect to the server. 
This will be ran on localhost : 9999 
There will be need for the tool to run another script to check the connectioons and verify a socket, we can assume this will be the automated test procedure.
